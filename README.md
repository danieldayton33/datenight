Conitinuation of a group project with Desmond Mullen (desmondmullen), Hooman Foroudastan (hoomanfor), Sadric Bonner (scbonner), and John Alexander (jskwru11). See the initial github repo at https://github.com/jskwru11/project-1.

This update finishes the initial project by finalizing the movie portion of the app and also makes some alterations to the UI.

For the initial project, Desmond handled the google maps and firebase portions. Sadric and Hooman did work on the frontend. John Alexander worked on the Gracenote API. I worked on the yelp API, on-click events, and tables. The biggest hurdle currently is changing the Gracenote API JSON to the format we need. John started this, but I aim to finish it.
